it and give you feedback!

# Pull requests
Please take a look at our [conventions](docs/conventions.md).

**If you fork this project and create a Pull Request then no checks are run. You need to join the Integreat organisation in order to contribute properly. Nontheless a PR is a good first step to get into contact.**

Before you can merge the code has to be reviewed and the status checks need to pass.
The CI runs the linter, type-checks, e2e tests and all unit tests. So better run these locally first before pushing.

When you merge to develop a debug release is deployed on [webnext.integreat-app.de](https://webnext.integreat-app.de/).
