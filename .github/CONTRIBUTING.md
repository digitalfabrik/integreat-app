# Merging
Before you can merge the code has to be reviewed and the status checks need to pass.
The CI runs the linter, type-checks and all unit tests. So better run these locally first before pushing.

When you merge to develop a debug release is deployed on [webnext.integreat-app.de](https://webnext.integreat-app.de/).
