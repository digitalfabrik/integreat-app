# Getting in touch

You usually can start contributing by asking one of our developers for a task:
* <ammann@integreat-app.de>

If you encounter any issues with the app you can also just create a pull request and we'll review 
it and give you feedback!

# Merging
Before you can merge the code has to be reviewed and a [jenkins build](https://build.integreat-app.de/job/integreat-webapp/)
needs to pass.
The CI runs the linter, flow and all unit tests. So better run these locally first before pushing.

If you merge something into develop or master you **have to** do a no-fast-forward merge.
Do this by running `git merge <feature-branch> --no-ff`.

When you merge to develop a new debug release is pushed to [webnext.integreat-app.de](https://webnext.integreat-app.de/).
