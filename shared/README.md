# Shared

Implementation of the [integreat-cms](https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-cms) endpoints ([api documentation](https://digitalfabrik.github.io/integreat-cms/api-docs.html))

Tasks of the Shared:

- Simple usage of the different endpoints
- Fetching data from the cms
- Mapping of the JSON responses to our internal models
