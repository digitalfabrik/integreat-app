## Getting Started

We suggest **[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** as IDE for editing JavaScript code. JetBrains provides free licences for students.
If you are using a different IDE, the steps might differ.

*Note: For the setup of the project on Windows you may want to use Chocolatey and [follow this guide](docs/windows-setup.md).*

### Prerequisites

* Rate our Integreat app in the [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tuerantuer.app.integreat)
and the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/integreat/id1072353915).
* Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/). At least v10 is required, but we recommend the v12 LTS.
Using the latest version (v13) may lead to errors.
* Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

#### Android

* Install the Android SDK by using the [Android Support plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1792-android-support) in IntelliJ.
* Install the latest stable SDK Platform and Android SDK Tools in the SDK Manager (Settings > Appearance & Behaviour > System Settings > Android SDK)
* \[optional\]: If you want to develop using an emulator, also install the Android Emulator in the Android SDK settings

#### iOS

* Own a Mac or another Apple device.
* Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

*Note: In order to work with the XCode project, always open `ios/Integreat.xcworkspace`.*

### Project setup

If using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate you can import the project easily:

* Import this project (VCS > Get from Version Control).
* Run `yarn` in the terminal to install all dependencies.
* Take a look at package.json to show all available npm scripts.
* Run `yarn start` to start the bundler.

*Note: For editing native Java code for Android IntelliJ with the Android extension is recommended. For native Swift/Objective-C code [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is required.*

#### Running the app

Take a look at the docs for [iOS](docs/manual-builds.md#ios) and [Android](docs/manual-builds.md#android) to see how to run the app.

#### Additional Configuration

* Mark the *src* folder as *Source directory*.
* Run > Edit Configurations > Defaults > Jest
   to set *Configuration file* to *jest.config.json*

* Settings > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript and
    * choose *Flow* as Language version
    * set *Flow package or executable* to *<project_dir>/node_modules/flow-bin*

* [optional] Associate the *\*.snap* files with the file type *JavaScript*.
* [optional] Install the following plugins:
    * [Styled Components](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9997-styled-components--styled-jsx/)
    * [Ruby](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1293-ruby) (if working with Fastlane)
