# Design Changes

###### WIP Change: Improve "Offers"
* Discussion on the next conference: Break Extras category up into Jobs, Apartment, Other (Other as category for extra wishes) â†’ There is no icon and no wording that summarizes all extras, through the categorized presentation, the offers become more visible and more newcomers can benefit


###### Design Change: Release of the react-native app
The design of the react-native app will differ in a few points.
* "Extras" will be changed to "Angebote" (eng. "Offers")
* "News" will be changed to "Events"
* The tabs will be removed on Android and iOS
* A Dashboard is added:

 Note: The circular navigation tiles on the dashboard will be white
 Note: The event preview is planned for a future design change.\
 Note: The header should contain the Integreat logo without the string "Integreat" xor the back button on iOS and Android.
* If the user wants to change from a Page to an Event he has to navigate back to the Dashboard
* A new set of Icons will be defined and will replace all icons
* 'name_without_prefix' should be displayed in Header. The 'prefix' should be added in brackets. Like: Augsburg (Landkreis)
* There will be no language selection screen after selecting a city
* The new intro slides will be displayed after selecting a city

Nice to have:
* If possible try to add the name of the current city to multiple routes
