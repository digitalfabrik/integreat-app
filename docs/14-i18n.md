# I18n

The app has two languages:
* **UI language**
* **Content language**

## UI language

The UI language is always the primary system language and cannot be changed.

All UI and navigation elements are using the UI language and the corresponding layout direction, i.e. LTR or RTL.
UI/navigation elements are:
* Header
* Navigation tiles
* Settings
* Errors
* Notifications, popups and dialogs

## Content language

The content language is changeable in the app and is set to the UI language at the first app start.

All content elements are using the content language and the corresponding layout direction, i.e. LTR or RTL.
Content elements are all elements that are NOT UI elements, especially
* Webview content
* Categories, Events, Offers tiles and lists
* LastUpdate

## WIP: To discuss

* Feedback

* Landing page
