During this upgrade I tried to get the iOS and Android project to a stable state. This means it should be not quite
similar to an initial react-native project.
The AppleTV project is still not included. It's probably easier to keep it removed from the iOS project.

Reason for the upgrade was a [problem with iOS 12.2](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player/issues/513).
