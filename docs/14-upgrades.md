# Upgrades

## From 0.56.0 to 0.59.9

[Patch file](upgrade-diffs/0.56.0-0.59.9.diff) (Only for a reference. This was not applied directly!)

During this upgrade I tried to get the iOS and Android project to a stable state. This means it should be not quite
similar to an initial react-native project.
The AppleTV project is still not included. It's probably easier to keep it removed from the iOS project.
