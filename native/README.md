## Project Setup

_Make sure to have read and followed the steps in the [general README](../README.md#project-setup)._

- Run `yarn` in the terminal to install all dependencies.
- Take a look at the [available scripts](package.json). The most important scripts are also available as IntelliJ Run
  Configurations.

Depending on whether you want to develop for Android, iOS or both the following extra steps are necessary:

### Android

- Install Java JDK, SDK and Runtime (v8 or v11).
- Install the Android SDK by using
  the [Android Support plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1792-android-support) in IntelliJ.
- Install the latest stable SDK Platform and Android SDK Tools in the SDK Manager (Settings > Appearance & Behaviour >
  System Settings > Android SDK).
- Install and accept the SDK license in the SDK Manager.
- \[optional\]: If you want to develop using an emulator, also install the Android Emulator in the Android SDK settings.

### iOS

- Own a Mac or another Apple device.
- Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

_Note: In order to work with the project in XCode, always open `ios/Integreat.xcworkspace`._

### Additional Configuration

- Run > Edit Configurations > Defaults > Jest:
  - Set _Configuration file_ to _jest.config.json_
- [optional] Associate the _\*.snap_ files with the file type _JavaScript_
- [optional] Install the following plugins:
  - [Styled Components](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9997-styled-components--styled-jsx/)
  - [Ruby](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1293-ruby) (if working with Fastlane)

## Running the app

Take a look at the docs for [iOS](docs/manual-builds.md#ios) and [Android](docs/manual-builds.md#android) to see how to
