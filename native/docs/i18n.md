# I18n

The app has two languages:

- **[UI language](#ui-language)**
- **[Content language](#content-language)**

As a rule of thumb: Everything that is important during counselling should be content language, everything else UI language.
Our reasoning for the separation of UI language from content language:
- For counselling, counsellors use the language change to show users the content in a different language, not to change their whole (and accustomed) UI
- For our real target group, language change is mainly used to verify information in German or English if the information in their native language doesn't have all the information or doesn't look trustworthy

In both cases, the language change is just about the language of the content, not about the UI and layout.
There is not really a reason to change the UI language of an app if it matches the chosen system language.

## UI language

The UI language is always the primary system language and cannot be changed.

All UI elements are using the UI language and the corresponding layout direction, i.e. LTR or RTL.
UI elements are:

- Header
- Navigation tiles
- Settings
- Errors
- Notifications, popups and dialogs
- Feedback
- Search
- Language change
- Landing page
- LastUpdate

### Translations

The translated texts (translations) can be found in the [translations sub-project](../../translations). For more information see its [README](../../translations/README.md).

## Content language

The content language is changeable in the app and is set to the system language (if available, German otherwise) at the first app start.

All content elements are using the content language and the corresponding layout direction, i.e. LTR or RTL.
Content elements are all elements that are NOT UI elements/fetched from the CMS, especially:

- Webview content
- Categories, Events, Offers tiles and lists,
