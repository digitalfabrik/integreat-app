# I18n

The app has two languages:
* **UI language**
* **Content language**

As a rule of thumb: Everything that is import during counselling should be content language, everything else UI language

## UI language

The UI language is always the primary system language and cannot be changed.

All UI elements are using the UI language and the corresponding layout direction, i.e. LTR or RTL.
UI elements are:
* Header
* Navigation tiles
* Settings
* Errors
* Notifications, popups and dialogs
* Feedback
* Search
* Language change
* Landing page
* LastUpdate

### Locales

The localized texts (locales) can be found in the [locales sub-project](../../locales). For more information see its [README](../../locales/README.md).

## Content language

The content language is changeable in the app and is set to the UI language at the first app start.

All content elements are using the content language and the corresponding layout direction, i.e. LTR or RTL.
Content elements are all elements that are NOT UI elements, especially:
* Webview content
* Categories, Events, Offers tiles and lists
