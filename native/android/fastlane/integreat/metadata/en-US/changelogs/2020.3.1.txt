We've been working for you to fix several bugs:
* The app now displays all contents in Deutsch-Einfach and Tigrinya.
* The app always shows description texts for events if available.
* Opening PDFs from external URLs is possible now.
* The intro slides now adjust to the size of your screen.

Furthermore we've fixed some minor glitches and worked under the hood to increase performance and stability.
